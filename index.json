Furthermore, for the scenario of non-compressible ergodic sequences, we provide a closed-form expression for the best k-term relative approximation error when only a fraction (rate) of the most significant sequence coefficients are kept as the sequence-length tends to infinity. We analyze basic properties of this rate-approximation error curve, which is again a function of the invariant measure of the process.  Revisiting the case of i.i.d. sequences, we completely identify the family of compressible processes, which reduces to look at a polynomial order decay (heavy-tail) property of the distribution.","tags":["ergodic properties","spase models","compressibility","compressed sensing","heavy-tail distributions"],"title":"On the Characterization of Compressible Ergodic Sequences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jorge F.
